# gui TTRPG char maker and ruleset
what am i trying to do?
a basic GUI that contains buttons on a menu that show different info,
rolls stats for a character and stores it in a way that it can be 
easily sent as a character file, optionally id also like to have all 
the actions you can take by default as buttons to preform, with 
any bonuses as easy add ons to the roll
and then even more optionally have the outcome print out to whatever 
VTT were using
